For the Thought Bubble Project, I helped with initial research on how to implement the gathered 
features we wanted in our server. Most of these features were selected from Google Drive and Github's
functioning features. I also helped write a chunk of the report and make the presentation slides. 
In terms of the project itself, I personally lack proficiency in the C or C++ language, so I mostly 
helped by researching how to conceptually create a web server with a stable, multi-threaded client 
connection and also helped by running tests to check for correct functionality and as well as checking
for bugs.
